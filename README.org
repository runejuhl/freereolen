* freereolen
Turn books from [[https://ereolen.dk][ereolen.dk]] into proper ePub files, to make it possible to read
borrowed books with any ePub reader. ePubs created with ~freereolen~ have been
tested and found working in [[https://fbreader.org/][FBReader]] on Android and Linux, on a Barnes&Noble
nook (gen1) and on a Kobo Libra H2O.

Works by grabbing pages and resources using curl, doing a bit of magic and
converting it all into an ePub using ~zip~ and ePub XML templates rendered with
~bash~.

** Features
+ automagically creates ToC even for (some) really broken books
+ i18n layer to translate ToC names into local languages
+ fetches external resources
+ lints HTML using ~tidy~

** Usage
See also help text:
#+begin_src sh
./run.sh
#+end_src

+ borrow a book on [[https://www.ereolen.dk][ereolen.dk]]
+ open it for reading
+ open the Web Developer view and select the "Network" tab
+ apply filter so that only JavaScript is shown
+ browse to a new page
+ find a request whose URL matches
  ~https://streaming.pubhub.dk/publicstreaming/v3/69f63101-9caf-40b9-a31e-b2fdb5642e3d/43c44150-9d2c-4506-8fe6-c0bb904ea563/1/?callback=jQuery11100348712123123213_123123121313&_=1231313123123~
  (the important thing to look for is the last part of the URL before the query
  string)
+ run the program with the URL as argument, e.g. ~./run.sh
  'https://streaming.pubhub.dk/publicstreaming/v3/69f63101-9caf-40b9-a31e-b2fdb5642e3d/43c44150-9d2c-4506-8fe6-c0bb904ea563/1/?callback=jQuery11100348712123123213_123123121313&_=1231313123123'~

** Known bugs
+ doesn't work with all books, especially graphics-heavy ones (e.g. graphic
  novels made from images and associated text)
+ will often choke (on purpose) on links to external sites, which will need to
  be removed or whitelisted

** Help wanted
+ CSS tidy
+ support for overdrive.com (as English language books are often only available
  there)
+ support for automatically fetching books instead of having to manually go and
  find the correct URL
